# Landing Page: The Odin Project 📝  
Project #2 in Foundations. Building a website using a [photo](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) reference.  

## Expectation 🚀  
- Learn how to create a website using flexbox and only a photo reference. 
- No inspecting elements of other examples. 
- Using search engines to figure out the gaps.

## Takeaway on completion 🔥  
It was a lot easier to think how to approach building a website from scratch when thinking of how many sections it breaks down into. Flexbox was extremely satisfying to learn as I went.
I enjoyed the challenge of only using an image reference.

## Time to complete ✨  
1 day, around 6 hours a day between researching and coding. I looked up things like CSS rounded corners and importing fonts.

## Additional notes 🗒️
As an extra challenge to myself, I completed around 400 lines of code in nano using the terminal before I took it to VS Code for final tweaks, super proud! I would have liked to have done this with SCSS.
 
### Tools ⚙️ 
VSCode, git, HTML5, CSS3, nano, flexbox, ReadMe Editor
